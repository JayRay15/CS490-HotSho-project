## ❓ FAQ

**Q: I marked recommendations complete but my score didn't change. Why?**  
A: The algorithm tracks actual preparation data, not just checkbox clicks. You need to actually complete the underlying work:
- For "Complete Company Research" → Generate company research from job/interview details
- For "Complete Mock Interviews" → Do actual mock interview sessions in Interview Coaching
- For "Increase Practice Time" → Complete preparation tasks in interview details

The "Mark Complete" button is just a reminder/tracking system, not the data entry point.

**Q: How often is my score recalculated?**  
A: Automatically every 24 hours, or immediately when you click "Recalculate" or complete a recommendation.

**Q: Can my score decrease?**  
A: No, once you've completed preparation activities, they remain in the system. However, confidence may decrease if your interview is approaching and you haven't prepared enough.

**Q: What's the confidence score?**  
A: Confidence measures how much data we have to make the prediction. More completed activities = higher confidence (0-100%).
