## 🎉 STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The account deletion email functionality is **complete and working**. You just need to configure SMTP if you want to send real emails.

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Development/Testing (No Setup Required)
**Nothing!** Just run your server. Emails will be logged to console.

### Option 2: Send Real Emails (5-Minute Setup)

1. **Open** `backend/.env` file

2. **Add these lines**:
   ```env
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

   SMTP_SECURE=false
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   SMTP_FROM="Nirvana <no-reply@nirvanaprofile.com>"
   ```

3. **Get Gmail App Password**:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/
   - Security → 2-Step Verification (enable it)
   - Security → App passwords → Create new
   - Copy the 16-character password
   - Paste as `SMTP_PASS`

4. **Restart server**
