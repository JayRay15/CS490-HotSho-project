**Total Compensation = Base + Bonus + Equity + Benefits**

### What to Consider

1. **Base Salary** (40% weight)
   - Guaranteed money
   - Affects future raises
   - Most important for financial planning

2. **Bonus** (20% weight)
   - Performance-based
   - May vary year to year
   - Tax implications

3. **Equity** (20% weight)
   - Long-term value
   - Vesting schedule matters
   - Company growth potential

4. **Benefits** (20% weight)
   - Health insurance
   - 401k match
   - PTO/flexibility
   - Professional development

### Decision Matrix

  ├─ No → Decline or counter again
  └─ Yes → Continue

Is it within 10% of your desired salary?
  ├─ Yes → Strong candidate to accept

Are there competing offers?
